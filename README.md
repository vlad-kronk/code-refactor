# Code Refactoring Project
### by Jacob Meyers


## Description

I wanted to make the HTML of a webpage more accessible to search engines and other developers. It lacked specificity in its tags, and it was hard to understand. I learned how semantic tags in HTML work and what they mean.

## Installation

Run ```git clone``` on the repository.

## Usage

Open in browser.

![The Horiseon webpage includes a semantically tagged navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Develop/assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
